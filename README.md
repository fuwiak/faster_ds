# 🚀 faster\_llm

**`faster_llm`** is an **open-source Python framework** designed to accelerate and simplify routine data preprocessing and analysis. Inspired by the Scikit-Learn API, it integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning tools and modern LLM (Large Language Model) frameworks — making it an ideal bridge between traditional ML workflows and generative AI capabilities.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* Built on **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn** APIs
* Modular design for easy integration into existing ML pipelines
* Rapid prototyping of preprocessing and analysis workflows
* Connector modules to **LLM frameworks** like:

  * [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
  * [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)

## 🔌 LLM Integration

`faster_llm` serves as a **bridge between classic ML pipelines and modern LLM tooling**.

### You can:

* Train models using your favorite frameworks like **scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, or **Keras**
* Automatically pass metrics, charts, and pipeline artifacts to LLMs (e.g., **Mistral-7B**)
* Classification results can be sent directly to your LLM for further analysis
* Generate reports, insights, or even code based on model results — all with minimal setup

> Think of it as a seamless connector between your ML stack and smart assistants powered by LLMs.
